# Introduction to Iterative Statements/Loops

The simple dictionary meaning of loop is a structure, series, or process, the end of which is connected to
the beginning. We have the following types of iterative statements -
# The while loop
# The for loop
# The do-while loop

# The For Loop

The advantage of a for loop is we know exactly how many times the loop will execute even before the
actual loop starts executing.

Syntax:
for (init-statement; condition; final-expression){
statement
// logic
}

# Init-statement: This statement is used to initialize or assign a starting value to a variable which
may be altered over the course of loop (we will see this while solving examples). It is used/referred
only once at the start of the loop.

# Condition: This condition serves as a loop control statement. The loop block is executed until the
condition evaluates to true.

#Final expression: It is evaluated after each iteration of the loop. It is generally to update the
values of the loop variables.

Example:
for(int i = 1; i < 6; i++ ){
cout << i << " ";
}

Output:
1 2 3 4 5

# The while loop

A while loop is a loop that runs through its body, known as a while statement, as long as a
predetermined condition is evaluated as true.
Syntax:

while (condition)
statement;

Example:
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5)
{
cout << i << “ “;
i = i + 1;
}
Output:
1 2 3 4 5

# The do-while loop

Do-while loop tests the condition at the end of each execution for the next iteration. In other words,
the loop is executed at least once before the condition is checked. Rest everything is the same as
while loop.
Syntax:

do
{
statement;
} while (condition);

Example:
int idx = 1;
do
{
cout << idx << “ “;
idx++;
} while (idx <= 5);

Output:
1 2 3 4 5
