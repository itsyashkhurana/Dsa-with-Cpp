Ques:- If an item's cost price and selling price are input through the keyboard, write a program to determine whether the seller has made a profit or incurred a loss.

Profit =SP-CP
Cp =40
SP =60
Loss = CP-SP
Profit  SP>CP
Loss    CP>SP or SP<CP

code:-
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main (){

cout<<"Enter the cost price ";
int CP;
cin>>CP;
cout<<" Enter the selling price";
int SP;
cin>>SP;
if(SP>CP){
cout<< " profit";
}
else{// SP<CP
cout<<"loss";
}

}
